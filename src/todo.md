<!-- context api -->

# step 1

- [x] create context
- [x] provider (the delivery boy)
- [x] consumer (make sure you recieved your data)
- [x] useContext hook (to simplify API)

# step 2

- [x] export appProvider & import it from [App.jsx]
- [x] in Provider you should add value to provide datas
- [x] now export AppContext
- [x] choose a folder like [About], use useContext and inside useContext braks import [AppContext]
- [explain] cause there is a provider in [AppContext] and also a value so you can access easily provider and it's value through [AppContext]
- [x] You can simplify this by global custom hooks

# step -3

 <!-- we're gonna use useReducer here, so our all datas are stored in reducer and we'll'a pick data from reducer -->

- [x] will need data in 3 initial parts, which are loading, data & error handle
